# User Management System

It is a backend project in which I have used NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB for storing and retrieving the user details from the database with help of various CRUD operation methods of NodeJS.

- GET     : to get the user records
- POST    : to add a new user record 
- DELETE  : to delete an existing user record 
- PUT     : to update a user record
