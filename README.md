# Student Management System

It is a backend project in which I have used NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB for storing and retrieving the student details from the database with help of various CRUD operation methods of NodeJS.

GET - to get the student records
POST - to add a new student record 
DELETE - to delete an existing student record 
PUT - to update a student record
